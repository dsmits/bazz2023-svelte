It is hard to tell which dance style is my favourite as I am specialized in Popping, Locking and Whacking, and these three nurture me in their own way on a daily basis! But I am anyway super excited to share with you all and explore the connections (trust me, there are a lot) between Swing styles and Funk/disco styles! It's gonna be social, it's gonna be deep, it's gonna be funky üî• See you all at Bazz!",
